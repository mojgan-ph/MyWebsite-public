Here’s a clean, minimal design concept for a startup offering data-science and machine-learning consultations. The goal is to convey professionalism, technological expertise, and easy access to key information.

Color Palette and Typography
• Primary colors:
– Deep navy (#1a1f3b) for headers and footers
– Teal accent (#2ab7ca) for buttons and links
• Secondary colors: soft grays (#f5f6fa, #e1e2e6) for backgrounds and content areas
• Font choices:
– Heading: Montserrat (bold, modern sans-serif)
– Body: Open Sans or Lato (clean, legible)
Overall Layout
• Full-width header with logo (top left) and horizontal navigation (top right)
• Hero section beneath header, featuring a concise tagline, a brief value proposition, and a prominent “Get a Free Consultation” call-to-action (CTA) button
• Three-column services overview, followed by a “How It Works” horizontal step bar
• Footer with contact information, social links, and quick nav links
Page Structure
A. Home
– Hero: background image or subtle animation of data visualizations
– Services snapshot:
1. Data Strategy & Roadmapping
2. Predictive Modeling & AI Prototyping
3. Data Engineering & Automation
Each with an icon, a one-sentence description, and a “Learn More” link
– How It Works (simple 3-step flow):
1. Book a Call → 2. Custom Proposal → 3. Project Kickoff
– “Why Choose Us” bullet points: multidisciplinary expertise, collaborative process, transparent pricing
– Footer
B. Services (detail page)
– Overview intro paragraph
– Individual service sections (expandable panels or separate anchor links)
• Data Strategy & Assessment
• Machine Learning Model Development
• Data Pipeline & Infrastructure
– Each section: challenges addressed, deliverables, timeline estimate, example client outcome
C. About Us
– Company mission statement
– Culture snippet (remote-first? office location?)
D. Contact / Book a Consultation
– Simple form: name, email, company, project overview text area
– Calendar embed or link to scheduling tool (e.g., Calendly)
– Office address / general contact email
Interaction & Responsiveness
• Mobile-first breakpoints: stacked nav (hamburger menu), hero content centered, single-column services
• Smooth scroll to sections from nav links
• Hover states on buttons (subtle shadow or color lighten)
• Lazy-loaded images and animations for performance
Additional Touches
• Logo animation on page load (e.g., data lines drawing in)
• Floating “Book a Call” CTA button on lower right corner for quick access
• GDPR-compliant cookie banner and privacy policy link in footer
